# Module 2 Challenge
- This is a README for our second challenge for our coding bootcamp
## Description of challenge
- Building a portfolio of work that can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. That is exactly what I am doing here with this challenge.
## What I did in this assignment
- Learned more about "hovering" in CSS and the functionality of it
- Used variables for the first time that we learned in class while I was working on this challenge
- Used flexbox containers that we learned about after doing a mini project in class for it
- Learned more about navigation and using buttons on my website to navigate through the UI and it was one of my favorite parts of this challenge
- Worked with a ton of colors and fonts to get what resembles me best and I love how it turned out
- Learned about the CSS @media rule and used that to adjust the site when on a small screen (phones)
- Used colors to fit with a picture I took in Florida (not finished just a starter)
- Decided to just try my best to go off of the template given to us but made my own minor tweaks (this is my first time making a site
## Importance of this assignment
- This challenge is important for building a portfolio of all of my work that I do throughout the course and use it at the end for my job searching
- To build a appication from scratch! (my first time)
